# **Derma\_AI**

**AI-based Skin Disease Detection Platform**

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Derma\_AI** is an end-to-end, production-grade framework for developing, training, validating, and deploying state-of-the-art AI models for skin disease detection from clinical and real-world images. It supports a rigorous, governance-driven workflow designed for extremely high accuracy, bias mitigation, HIPAA/GDPR compliance, and reproducibility.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Robust data ingestion, versioning, and annotation pipeline (DVC, Git)
* Structured data lake architecture (`raw/`, `processed/`, `external/`)
* Modular, reproducible codebase for preprocessing and model development
* Advanced machine learning support (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Ensembles)
* Full experiment tracking (MLflow / Weights & Biases)
* Built-in bias and fairness evaluation
* CI/CD pipelines for model testing and deployment (GitHub Actions + Docker)
* Secure by design: encrypted cloud storage, PHI protection
* Clinical feedback and strict validation pipeline

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Git
* DVC
* Docker
* Access to cloud storage (AWS S3, GCP Bucket, etc.)

## 🧪 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Derma_AI.git
cd Derma_AI
```

Create and activate the environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure DVC remote:

```bash
dvc remote add -d s3remote s3://your-dvc-bucket
dvc pull
```

Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to include your credentials
```

---

## 🔄 Data & Pipeline Update

Add new data to `data/raw/`:

```bash
dvc add data/raw/new_batch
git commit -m "Add new data batch"
dvc push
```

* Update metadata/config in `/config/`
* All changes go through Pull Requests with CI checks

---

## 🧠 Experimentation & Model Training

* Data pipeline: `src/data/`
* Model dev: `src/models/`
* Evaluation: `src/evaluate/`
* Track with **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases**
* Store results in `/results/`, `/logs/`, `/models/`

---

## 👥 Team Workflow

* GitHub Flow: feature branches + pull requests
* Weekly sprints and code reviews
* DVC for data/model tracking
* Clinical review included in dev cycle
* All docs in `/docs/` (QA, data dictionaries, architecture diagrams)

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

* AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit
* Role-based cloud IAM access
* Audit logs and compliance docs available in `/docs/`
* Aligns with HIPAA, GDPR, and medical device regulation standards

---
